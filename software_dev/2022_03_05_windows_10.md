A little how-to guide on what services to turn off after installing Windows 10 because these services are a pain in the ass and on the disk.

These instructions were gathered from various sources, mostly vetted by the Reddit community, and have worked for my Windows 10 Pro edition, and I am using an Administrator account.

# Toggle SuperFetch aka SysMain
1. Run `services.msc`
2. Locate **SuperFetch** or **SysMain** and open *Properties*.
3. Stop the service.
4. Set the run permissions to *Disabled*

# Toggle Windows Updates
1. Run `gpedit.msc`
2. Navigate ***Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Updates***
3. Open **Configure Automatic Updates**
4. Select *Enable*, and set the value to *5*

# Turn off Windows Defender Permanently
1. Navigate ***Windows Security -> Virus & Threat Protection ***
2. Make sure to turn **File Protection** and **Real-time Monitoring** to *Off*.
3. Restart the device immediately as you only have 10 minutes to do the next steps.
4. Run `gpedit.msc`
5. Navigate ***Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Defender Antivirus*** 
6. Open **Turn off Windows Defender Antivirus** and set to *Enabled*
7. Open **Allow antimalware service to remain running always** and set to *Disabled*
